2)The problem with Debug7b is the while statement, it should be an if statement.



3)The 2 problems with Debug7c is there is no search for the vowel "o".
Also, if a word end with a vowel, it will not register that vowel. So for the word "Steve" it will only register the first "e".

A way to fix both errors is to also search for the vowel "o".
As for not searching for the last vowel of a word, fix the test case "position < len-1" to "position <= len-1"
