MANY QUIZZES LIKE TO TEST SPELLING, SUCH AS XYLOPHONE OR JAGUAR.
I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE ALL CAPS, BUT IT SIMPLIFIES THE PROBLEM.
THERE IS A HOPE THAT THIS FILE WILL CONTAIN ALL POSSIBLE LETTERS,
BUT I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY QUALITY WORDS THEIR MAY BE.  ONE
SUCH WORD MIGHT BE ZEBRA OR ZANZIBAR.  ANYWAY, THIS IS A VERY, VERY,
GOOD SAMPLE FOR YOUR PROGRAM.
