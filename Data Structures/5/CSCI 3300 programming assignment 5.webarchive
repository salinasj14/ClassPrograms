<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A <span class="term">graph</span> is a collection of 
<span class="term">vertices</span>
connected by a collection of <span class="term">edges</span>.  
An edge connects exactly
two vertices to one another.  You can draw a picture
of a graph by showing the vertices and the edges connecting them.
Here is an example.  The vertices are shown as circles with 
numbers in them and the edges are lines connecting the vertices.
</p>

<p></p><div align="center">
  <img src="graph1.gif">
</div><p></p>

<p>Two vertices are said to
be <span class="term">adjacent</span> if there is an edge that connects them
directly to one another.
In the graph above, vertices 1 and 2 are adjacent, but
1 and 4 are not adjacent.  A given edge is 
<span class="term">incident</span> on each of the vertices that
it connects.
</p>

<p>A <span class="term">path</span> is a sequence of vertices
where every consecutive pair of vertices are adjacent to one
another.
For example, in the above graph,
[3, 1, 2, 4] is a path that connects vertices 3 and 4.
</p>

<p>A graph is <span class="term">connected</span> if there is a path
from every vertex to every other vertex.
We will only be concerned with connected graphs here.
</p>

<p>A <span class="term">weighted graph</span> is a graph in 
which each edge has a number
attached to it, called the <span class="term">weight</span> of the edge.
Here is a picture of a weighted graph.
</p>

<a name="wgraph"></a>
<p></p><div align="center">
  <img src="graph2.gif">
</div><p></p>

<p>Think of the vertices of a graph as towns and the edges as roads.  
The weight of an edge is the length of the road.  
One thing that you might like to know is how to get from one town
to another by the shortest possible route.  For example, in the
weighted graph above, the shortest route from vertex 1 to vertex 5 is
to go from 1 to 3 and then from 3 to 5, and the length of that route is 27.
You add the weights of the edges that you use.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="requirements"></a>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Functional requirements</h3>

<p>Write a program that reads information about
a weighted graph from the
standard input.  The input format is described in
detail <a href="#inputformat">below</a>.
After the description of the graph, the input has two vertex numbers,
<i>s</i> and <i>t</i>.  
</p>

<p>Your program should print a description of the
graph, followed by the shortest 
path from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> and the distance from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> 
via that path, on the standard output.  
</p>

<p><a name="example"></a>For example, the input might look
like this.
<b></b></p><pre><b>5
1 2  9.0
1 3 12.0
2 4 18.0
2 3  6.0
2 5 20.0
3 5 15.0
0
1 5
</b></pre>
That says that there are five vertices.  There is an edge from
vertex 1 to vertex 2 with weight 9.0, an edge from vertex 1 to vertex 3
with weight 12.0, etc.  The start vertex <i>s</i>
is 1, and the end vertex <i>t</i> is 5.
The output for this input would be as follows.
<b><pre>There are 5 vertices.
The edges are as follows.

 (1,3) weight 12.000
 (1,2) weight 9.000
 (2,5) weight 20.000
 (2,3) weight 6.000
 (2,4) weight 18.000
 (3,5) weight 15.000

The shortest path from 1 to 5 has length 27.000 and is
1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 5
</pre></b>
<p></p>


<h3>Nonfunctional requirements</h3>

<p>This page describes an algorithm, based on Dijkstra's algorithm, for solving 
this problem, and provides additional details on how to implement it.
You are required to use this algorithm,
and to follow the guidelines for its implementation.  It is not
acceptable to rely on a different approach to the problem.
</p>

<p>Use sensible terminology in your program.  If something
is a graph, do not call it an edge.  If something is an edge, do not call it a
vertex.  Make variable and type names sensible.  Keep functions short and simple.
</p>

<p>As always, you must follow the
<a href="../../Notes/Standards/index.html">coding standards</a>
for this course.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="inputformat"></a>
<h2>Input Format</h2>

<p>The input starts with a line that tells how many vertices
the graph has.  If there are five vertices, then those vertices
have numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  In general, if there are <i>n</i> 
vertices, then they are numbered 1, â€¦, <i>n</i>.
</p>

<p>Following the first line are
the edges, one per line.  Each edge line has two integers and one
real number on it.
Line
<b></b></p><pre><b>2 4 5.4
</b></pre>
indicates that there is an edge between vertices 2 and 4,
and that its weight is 5.4.  The end of the list of edges is signaled
by a line that contains just a 0.  After that are the numbers
for vertices <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>.  An input describing graph 
<p></p>

<p></p><div align="center">
  <img src="graph2.gif">
</div><p></p>

<p>with start vertex 2 and end vertex 4 might look like this.
<b></b></p><pre><b>5
1 2  9.0
1 3 12.0
2 4 18.0
2 3  6.0
2 5 20.0
3 5 15.0
0
2 4
</b></pre>
<p></p>

<p><b>Important note.</b> The first number in the input is the number
of <i>vertices</i>, not the number of <i>edges</i>.  Do not use that
number to determine how many remaining lines need to be read.  Just 
keep reading edges until you read a 0.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="dijkstra"></a>
<h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>

<p>Imagine yourself at the start vertex.  You send out a
signal from there along each edge, 
where the signal takes <i>w</i> seconds
to traverse an edge of weight <i>w</i>.  For example,
if the start vertex is vertex 1 and there is an edge between
vertices 1 and 2 of weight 5.1, then the signal sent from
vertex 1 reaches vertex 2 after 5.1 seconds.
</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> time a signal reaches a vertex <i>v</i>,
you record the time at which the signal arrived and which vertex the
signal arrived from.  Then you send a signal out on
all of the edges that are incident on vertex <i>v</i>
and whose other vertex has not yet received a signal.
</p>

<p>The second and subsequent times a signal arrives
at a vertex, the signal is ignored.
</p>

<p>The algorithm is finished when a signal reaches the end
vertex.  The time at which the signal arrived at the end
vertex is the distance from the start vertex to the
end vertex.
</p>

<p>Suppose that signaler(<i>u</i>) is the number of the
vertex from which the first signal reached vertex <i>u</i>.
Then path
[<i>u</i>, signaler(<i>u</i>), signaler(signaler(<i>u</i>)), ...]
is the shortest path from <i>u</i> back to the start vertex.
</p>


<h3>Discrete event simulation</h3>

<p>This program must simulate sending and receiving signals.
It keeps a list of
<span class="term">events</span>, where an event holds
three pieces of information, (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>t</i>),
and indicates the arrival of a signal at vertex <i>v</i> 
at time <i>t</i>, where the signal was sent from vertex <i>u</i>.
</p>

<p>The idea is to store the events in increasing order by 
the times at which they occur.  The program repetitively
performs the following steps.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>
    Get the next event (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>t</i>).
    The next event is the one that occurs next in chronological order.
    So it is the one with the smallest time.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    If no signal has yet arrived at vertex <i>v</i>, then
    do the following.
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><p>
        Record signaler(<i>v</i>) = <i>u</i> and
        distance(<i>v</i>) = <i>t</i>.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        For each edge that is incident on vertex <i>v</i>
        (say, connecting <i>v</i> with vertex <i>x</i>
        and having weight <i>w</i>), schedule a new event
        (<i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>t</i>+<i>w</i>) indicating
        that a signal will arrive at vertex <i>x</i>, coming from
        vertex <i>v</i>, at a time that is <i>w</i> seconds 
        after time <i>t</i>.  That simulates sending a signal
        from <i>v</i> to <i>x</i>.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
  <p></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>To get going, set the signaler of each vertex to âˆ’1 to
indicate that no signal has yet arrived at that vertex.
Then create an initial event (0, <i>s</i>, 0.0)
that indicates a signal arriving at the start vertex <i>s</i> at time
0.0, coming from a fictitious vertex 0.  Then do the simulation
of events.
</p>

<h3>Getting the final answer</h3>

<p>When the simulation is finished, you will be able to follow a path
from <i>t</i> back to <i>s</i> by following the chain of signalers.
<b></b></p><pre><b>     <i>t</i> -----&gt; signaler(<i>t</i>) -------&gt; signaler(signaler(<i>t</i>)) ----&gt; ... -----&gt; <i>s</i>
</b></pre>
Print that chain out <i>backwards</i>, so that it goes from <i>s</i>
to <i>t</i> instead of from <i>t</i> to <i>s</i>.  
The easiest way to do that is
to use recursion.  To print a path backwards, starting at vertex <i>u</i>,
print the path starting at signaler(<i>u</i>) backwards, then print <i>u</i>.
Of course, in the special case where <i>u</i> is the start vertex
<i>s</i>, just print <i>s</i>.  Remember to put <tt>-&gt;</tt> between
vertex numbers.
<p></p>

<hr>
<a name="info"></a>
<h2>Information about Vertices and Graphs</h2>

<p>You will need to store some information for each vertex in
the graph.  Create a structure type that holds information about
a vertex.
</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>
   Each vertex has a <i>distance</i> from the start vertex.
 </p></li>

 <li><p>
   Each vertex <i>v</i> has a <i>signaler</i>.
 </p></li>

 <li><p>
   Each vertex has a linked list of edge descriptions, telling
   the vertices that are adjacent to this vertex and the weight of
   the edge that connects them.
   So each cell in the linked list holds (1) another vertex number
   and (2) a weight.  
   (This list is called the <span class="term">adjacency list</span>
   of this vertex.)
 </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Create a type that holds information about a graph.  It should
hold (1) the number of vertices, (2) the start vertex (an integer),
(3) the end vertex and (4) an array holding a structure for each vertex.
Provide a constructor that takes an integer parameter <i>n</i> and
sets up the information for a graph with <i>n</i> vertices and no
edges.  Be sure that the information about each vertex is initialized.
</p>

<p>It is convenient to find the information about vertex <i>v</i>
in graph <i>g</i> to be <i>g</i>.info[<i>v</i>], assuming the array
is called info.  But remember that the vertices are numbered starting
at 1, so you want to use <i>g</i>.info[1], ..., g.info[<i>n</i>].
That means there are <i>n</i>+1 slots in the array.  You do not
use <i>g</i>.info[0].
</p>


<hr>
<a name="intermediate"></a>
<h2>Intermediate version</h2>

<p>Once the readGraph and printGraph functions are
working, submit them as assignment 5i.  Include a
main function that tests them.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="event"></a>
<h2>Events and the Event List</h2>

<p>Create a type Event that describes an event.  As explained
above, it holds two vertex numbers and a time.  Put the
definition of type Event in file <b>event.h</b>.  You
will want to have it in more than one place.  To avoid
the compiler reading the definition of type Event twice,
write the body of file event.h as follows.
</p><pre class="ccode">#ifndef EVENT_H
#define EVENT_H

struct Event
{
  â€¦
};

#endif
</pre>
This says that if
<a href="../../Notes/C/preprocessor.html">preprocessor</a> symbol
EVENT_H has not yet been defined, then define it and put the
definition of type Event in the program.  But if EVENT_H has
already been defined, then omit the (redundant) definition
of type Event.
<p></p>


<hr>
<a name="pq"></a>
<h2>Priority Queues</h2>

<p>You will need a data structure to hold the events that
have been scheduled.  If you think about the requirements
of such a data structure, you will see that you require the
following.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
    A way to create an initialized event queue with no events
    in it.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    A way to insert a new event into the event queue, with
    a given time.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    A way to remove the event that has the smallest time.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    A way to ask whether there are any events in the event queue.
  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those features are just what you have already implemented
as a <span class="term">priority queue</span>.  Just use
that module.  You will need to change the definition of
PQItemType to be Event.  You will need to make pqueue.h
include a header file that defines type Event.
</p>

<p>Ensure that your algorithm only uses features of the priority
queue module that are part of its interface.  Do not use
features that should remain hidden inside the priority queue
module!  You will lose a lot of points if you use non-exported
features of the priority queue module.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="graph"></a>
<h2>Graph.cpp</h2>

<p>Create a module, <b>graph.cpp</b>,
that is responsible for reading and writing graphs and performing
the shortest path algorithm.
Put the vertex and graph type definitions in it.  Include a
main function that reads and echoes the information in the
standard input, performs the simulation
and writes the path and its distance to the standard output.
</p>

<p>Provide functions to do the following tasks.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="trace"></a>
<h2>Tracing</h2>

<p>You are required to put trace (or debug) prints in your program
that can be turned on and off.  If tracing is turned on, trace the action
of Dijkstra's algorithm by doing the following.  Any time
the program shows a signal it must show signaler, the receiver and the
arrival time.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Show the sending of a signal.</li>
  <li>Show the arrival of a signal.</li>
  <li>Show updates when the first signal arrives at a vertex.</li>
</ol>

<p>The program should look at the command line.  If it contains
<b>-t</b>, then tracing should be turned on.  If not, tracing
should be turned off.
</p>

<hr>
<a name="submit"></a>
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>

<p>To turn in this program, log into one of the Linux computers
in the lab.  (You can log in remotely.)  Ensure that your files
are there.  Change to the directory that contains those files.
Then issue one of the following commands.
</p>

<dl>
